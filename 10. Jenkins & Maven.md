## Introduction: Jenkins & Maven

https://maven.apache.org/

Everytime a developer pushes to a specific branch, we want to trigger a jenkins job that is going to download the new code, build jar, execute unit test on that jar and it all test passes we need to deploy that.

## Install Maven plugin

- Manage jenkins > Manage plugin
- Install "Maven Integration" plugin

## Install Git plugin

- Manage jenkins > Manage plugin
- Install "Git" plugin 

## Clone Git/Github repo from Jenkins

- Create a new project (free style) and call it maven-project
- Go to the configure job 
- Look for Source Code Management and click Git
- Search for simple java maven app git (open github maven app)
- Repository URL: https://github.com/jenkins-docs/simple-java-maven-app 
- Specify the branch as master
- Now once the job is run, the job fetches the code and keeps it in /var/jenkins_home/workspace

## Build a JAR using maven

- Manage jenkins > Global Tool Configuration
- Look for Maven and Click Add Maven
- Specify name as jenkins-maven and choose a version from Version dropdown
- Save the configs.
- Go to the job maven-project and configure it
- Look for Build and Add build step
- Choose Invoke top-level Maven targets
- Selects Maven version that we defined as jenkins-maven
- Enter Goals as "-B -DskipTests clean package"
- Apply and Save and run the job

## Execute Unit Test

- Go to the job maven-project and configure it
- Look for Build and Add build step
- Choose Invoke top-level Maven targets
- Selects Maven version that we defined as jenkins-maven
- Enter Goals as "test"
- Apply and Save and run the job

## Deploy your JAR locally

- Go to the job maven-project and configure it
- Look for Build and Add build step
- Choose Execute shell
```shell
echo "****************"
echo "Deploying the JAR"
echo "****************"

java -jar /var/jenkins_home/workspace/maven-project/target/my-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Display the test results

- Go to the job maven-project and configure it
- Look for Post-build Actions & Choose Publish JUnit test result report
- Test report XMLs "target/surefire-reports/*.xml"

## Archive the last successful artifact

- Go to the job maven-project and configure it
- Look for Post-build Actions & Choose Archive the artifacts
- Enter the Files to archive as "target/*.jar"
- Click on Advanced option and check Archive artifacts only if build is successful
- Apply and Save
- You should see the archive in the build dashboard now

## Send Email notifications about the status of your maven project

- Go to the job maven-project and configure it
- Look for Post-build Actions & Choose E-mail Notification
- Add Recipients and save
