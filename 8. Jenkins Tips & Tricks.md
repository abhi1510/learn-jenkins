## Global environment variables

https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Building+a+software+project

- Create a new job (free style project) called jenkins-env 
- Configure the job: Add Build Step > Execute Shell
 ```shell
echo "BUILD_NUMBER: $BUILD_NUMBER"
echo "BUILD_ID: $BUILD_ID"
echo "BUILD_URL: $BUILD_URL"
echo "JOB_NAME: $JOB_NAME"
 ```
 
## Create your own custom global environment variables
 
- We shall add custom global variables when we want the variables to be available to all the projects.
- Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System
- Look for Global properties
- Checkbox Environment variables > Add
- Enter Name and Value and Save
- Go to the job jenkins-env and try to access these variables.
 ```shell
echo "********* Built-in Variables *********"
echo "BUILD_NUMBER: $BUILD_NUMBER"
echo "BUILD_ID: $BUILD_ID"
echo "BUILD_URL: $BUILD_URL"
echo "JOB_NAME: $JOB_NAME"

echo "********* Custom Variables *********"
echo "MY_NAME: $MY_NAME"
echo "COUNTRY: $COUNTRY"
 ```
 
## Modify the Jenkins URL
 
- Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System
- Look for Jenkins Location
- Update Jenkins URL
 
## Jenkins cron: execute Jobs automatically
 
- Go to the job jenkins-env and configure.
- Go to Build Triggers 
- Click on checkbox Build periodically
- H * * * * (every one minute).

## Trigger jobs externally: Create a generic user
 
- Manage jenkins > Manage Users
- Create a user called jenkins
- Manage jenkins > Manage & Assign Role
- Create a role called trigger-jobs
- Grant overall read, job read and build permissions
- Assign the role to jenkins user
 
## Trigger your Jobs (Without parameters) from Bash Scripts 
 
- We need a token and job build url to trigger the job remotely.
- Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security
- Look for CSRF Protection where we can see Default Crumb issuer is specified
- We need a crumb which is actually a token for triggering the job.
- Create a script file called remote.sh
```shell
crumb=$(curl -u "jenkins:1234" -s 'http://localhost:8080/crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,":",//crumb)')
curl -u "jenkins:1234" -H "$crumb" -X POST http://localhost:8080/job/my-first-job/build?delay=0sec
```

## Trigger your Jobs (With parameters) from Bash Scripts 
 
```shell
crumb=$(curl -u "jenkins:1234" -s 'http://localhost:8080/crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,":",//crumb)')
curl -u "jenkins:1234" -H $crumb -X POST http://localhost:8080/job/backup-db-aws/buildWithParameters?MYSQL_HOST=db&MYSQL_DB=testdb&AWS_S3_BUCKET=my-bucket
```
