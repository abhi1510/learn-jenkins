## Create your first Jenkins Job

Create a free style project with executable shell build that just prints "Hello World".

```shell
echo Hello World.
echo Current datetime is $(date)
```

## Redirect your first Job's output

```shell
Name=Abhinav
echo "Hello, $Name. Current datetime is $(date)" > /tmp/info
cat /tmp/info
```

## Execute a bash script from Jenkins

**Create a file called script.sh with contents as**

```shell
#!/bin/bash

echo Hello World
```

Trying to run this is going to give permission error. Use below to solve that

```shell
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

**Update the script to receive parameters**

```shell
#!/bin/bash

FNAME=$1
LNAME=$2

echo "Hello, $FNAME $LNAME"
```

Run this as below

```shell
./script.sh Abhinav Kumar
```

Now to copy this script to the jenkins container, we need to run below command

```shell
docker cp script.sh jenkins:/tmp/script.sh
```

**Configure the job to run the script**

```shell
/tmp/script.sh Abhinav Kumar
```

## Add parameters to your Job

- Click on the job
- Go to Configure
- In the General tab, click on This project is parameterized
- Click on Add Parameter and select String Parameter
- Add parameters like FIRST_NAME and LAST_NAME
- Finally, update the Execute shell as below
```shell
/tmp/script.sh $FIRST_NAME $LAST_NAME
```

Build button will change to Build with Parameters.

There are various types of parameters that we can add for our particular usecases.
